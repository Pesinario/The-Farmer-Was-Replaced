# Welcome to my code for "The Farmer Was Replaced"!
### A few things you should know about it:
* I am fairly inexperienced with both Python and Git, so please excuse any blunders I make.
* The goal of this project is **not** to get a *great* time on the leaderboard.
* The goals of this project **are:**
  * To learn how to use git properly
  * To write easy to read Python code
  * To hopefully be useful to someone, someday
#### If you're reading this, please use as many GitHub features as you can, make a fork, pull request and issue!
###### If you want to use any of my code, the "Timed Run.py" and "Method Tester.py" files can be run by themselves from inside the game.
Below is a list of the best time achieved with each version of the code, the goal is _somewhere around_ 30 minutes.
